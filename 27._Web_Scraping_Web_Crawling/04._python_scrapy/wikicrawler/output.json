Crystal growth is a dynamic process occurring in equilibrium where solute molecules or atoms precipitate out of solution, and dissolve back into solution.

Such liquids that crystallize on cooling are the exception rather than the rule.\n", "The nature of the crystallization process is governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors, which can make it highly variable and difficult to control. Factors such as impurity level, mixing regime, vessel design, and cooling profile can have a major impact on the size, number, and shape of crystals produced.\n", "As mentioned above, a crystal is formed following a well-defined pattern, or structure, dictated by forces acting at the molecular level.

This can occur in two conditions. The first is homogeneous nucleation, which is nucleation that is not influenced in any way by solids. These solids include the walls of the crystallizer vessel and particles of any foreign substance. The second category, then, is heterogeneous nucleation. This occurs when solid particles of foreign substances cause an increase in the rate of nucleation that would otherwise not be seen without the existence of these foreign particles.

If further processing of the crystals is desired, large crystals with uniform size are important for washing, filtering, transportation, and storage, because large crystals are easier to filter out of a solution than small crystals.", " Also, larger crystals have a smaller surface area to volume ratio, leading to a higher purity.

In special cases, for example during drug manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry, small crystal sizes are often desired to improve drug dissolution rate and bio-availability. The theoretical crystal size distribution can be estimated as a function of operating conditions with a fairly complicated mathematical process called population balance theory (using ", ").\n", "Some of the important factors influencing solubility are:\n", "So one may identify two main families of crystallization processes:\n", "This division is not really clear-cut, since hybrid systems exist, where cooling is performed through ", ", thus obtaining at the same time a concentration of the solution.\n", "A crystallization process often referred to in ", " is the ", ".

In the diagram, where equilibrium temperature is on the ", " and equilibrium concentration (as mass percent of solute in saturated solution) in ", ", it is clear that sulfate solubility quickly decreases below 32.5 °C.

The refrigerating fluid is sometimes also circulated in a jacket around the trough. Crystals precipitate on the cold surfaces of the screw/discs, from which they are removed by scrapers and settle on the bottom of the trough. The screw, if provided, pushes the slurry towards a discharge port.\n", "A common practice is to cool the solutions by flash evaporation: when a liquid at a given T", " temperature is transferred in a chamber at a pressure P", " such that the liquid saturation temperature T", " at P", " is lower than T", ", the liquid will release ", " according to the temperature difference and a quantity of solvent, whose total ", " of vaporization equals the difference in ", ". In simple words, the liquid is cooled by evaporating a part of it.\n", "In the sugar industry, vertical cooling crystallizers are used to exhaust the ", " in the last crystallization stage downstream of vacuum pans, prior to centrifugation. The massecuite enters the crystallizers at the top, and cooling water is pumped through pipes in counterflow.\n", "Another option is to obtain, at an approximately constant temperature, the precipitation of the crystals by increasing the solute concentration above the solubility threshold. To obtain this, the solute/solvent mass ratio is increased using the technique of ", ". This process is insensitive to change in temperature (as long as hydration state remains unchanged).\n", "All considerations on control of crystallization parameters are the same as for the cooling models.\n", "Most industrial crystallizers are of the evaporative type, such as the very large ", " and ", " units, whose production accounts for more than 50% of the total world production of crystals.

A pumping device (a ", " or an axial flow ", ") keeps the crystal ", " in homogeneous ", " throughout the tank, including the exchange surfaces; by controlling pump ", ", control of the contact time of the crystal mass with the supersaturated solution is achieved, together with reasonable velocities at the exchange surfaces. The Oslo, mentioned above, is a refining of the evaporative forced circulation crystallizer, now equipped with a large crystals settling zone to increase the retention time (usually low in the FC) and to roughly separate heavy slurry zones from clear liquid. Evaporative crystallizers tend to yield larger average crystal size and narrows the crystal size distribution curve.", "\n", "Whichever the form of the crystallizer, to achieve an effective ", " it is important to control the retention time and the crystal mass, to obtain the optimum conditions in terms of crystal specific surface and the fastest possible growth.", " This can be achieved by a separation – to put it simply – of the crystals from the liquid mass, in order to manage the two flows in a different way. The practical way is to perform a gravity ", " to be able to extract (and possibly recycle separately) the (almost) clear liquid, while managing the mass flow around the crystallizer to obtain a precise slurry density elsewhere. A typical example is the DTB (", ") crystallizer, an idea of Richard Chisum Bennett (a Swenson engineer and later President of Swenson) at the end of the 1950s. The DTB crystallizer (see images) has an internal circulator, typically an axial flow mixer – yellow – pushing upwards in a draft tube while outside the crystallizer there is a settling area in an annulus; in it the exhaust solution moves upwards at a very low velocity, so that large crystals settle – and return to the main circulation – while only the fines, below a given grain size are extracted and eventually destroyed by increasing or decreasing temperature, thus creating additional supersaturation. A quasi-perfect control of all parameters is achieved as DTF crystallizers offer superior control over crystal size and characteristics.", " This crystallizer, and the derivative models (Krystal, CSC, etc.) could be the ultimate solution if not for a major limitation in the evaporative capacity, due to the limited diameter of the vapor head and the relatively low external circulation not allowing large amounts of energy to be supplied to the system.\n"]},

Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid (Doudi Shoua), Rambo makes his way to the Soviet base and starts his attempts to free Trautman.

The book is an analysis of the widely believed narrative that American soldiers were spat upon and insulted by ", " upon returning home from the ", ".", " The book examines the origin of the earliest stories; the popularization of the \"spat-upon image\" through ", " and other media, and the role of print news media in perpetuating the now iconic image through which the history of the war and anti-war movement has come to be represented.\n", "Lembcke contrasts the absence of credible evidence of spitting by anti-war activists with the large body of evidence showing a mutually supportive, empathetic relationship between veterans and anti-war forces. The book also documents efforts of the ", " to drive a wedge between military service members and the anti-war movement by portraying democratic dissent as a betrayal of the troops. Lembcke equates this disparagement of the anti-war movement and veterans with the similar ", " propagated by Germany and France after their war defeats, as an alibi for why they lost the war.", " Lembcke details the resurrection of the myth of the spat-upon veteran during subsequent ", " efforts as a way to silence public dissent.\n", "A persistent but unfounded criticism leveled against those who protested in ", " is that they spat upon and otherwise derided returning soldiers, calling them \"baby-killers\". During the late 1980s and early 1990s, years after the ", " ended, the proliferation of these spitting stories increased greatly. As both a Vietnam veteran and a member of the anti-war movement, Lembcke knew this criticism ran counter to what he personally experienced and witnessed. To the contrary, one of the hallmarks of the period's anti-war movement was its support for the troops in the field and the affiliation of many returning veterans with the movement. Lembcke was motivated to look further into the truth and origins of this spat-upon veteran myth, and the contradiction between historical fact and popular ", ". Other observers had already noticed the proliferation of stories and questioned whether the spitting stories even made sense. In 1987, columnist ", " noted:\n", "Even during the most fervent days of anti-war protest, it seemed that it was not the soldiers whom protesters were maligning.  It was the leaders of government, and the top generals—at least, that is how it seemed in memory. One of the most popular chants during the anti-war marches was, \"Stop the war in Vietnam, bring the boys home.\" You heard that at every peace rally in America. \"Bring the boys home.\" That was the message. Also, when one thought realistically about the image of what was supposed to have happened, it seemed questionable.  So-called \"hippies,\" no matter what else one may have felt about them, were not the most macho people in the world. Picture a burly member of the Green Berets, in full uniform, walking through an airport.  Now think of a \"hippie\" crossing his path.  Would the hippie have the nerve to spit on the soldier?  And if the hippie did, would the soldier—fresh from facing enemy troops in the jungles of Vietnam—just stand there and take it?", "By 1992, the Director of the Connelly Library and curator of the Vietnam War Collection at ", " listed the spitting myth as one of the \"Top Six Myths\" from the Vietnam era, and observed the myth \"derives from the mythopoeic belief that returning GIs were routinely spat upon at some time during their repatriation to the USA. This particular round of tales has become so commonplace as to be treated reverently even among otherwise wisely observant veterans.\"", " In 1994, scholar Paul Rogat Loeb wrote, \"to consider spitting on soldiers as even remotely representative of the activist response is to validate a lie\", and noted that myths like that of anti-war activists spitting on soldiers have rewritten or \"erased history\".", " An academic study into the making and shaping of a collective memory found that evidence of antiwar activists targeting troops was virtually nonexistent. Instead, it found popular memory was manipulated by national security elites and a complicit news media by frequently labeling resistors to U.S. war efforts as \"anti-troop\".", " As observed by ", " after interviewing Lembcke and Greene, \"the stories have become so widely believed, despite a remarkable lack of witnesses or evidence, that ironically the burden of proof now falls on the accused, the protesters; not their accusers, the veterans. Antiwar protesters must prove the episodes didn't happen, instead of the veterans having to prove they did.\"", "\n", "Given this complete lack of evidence that spitting occurred, but acknowledging that it is impossible to prove something never happened, Lembcke set out:", "\n", "to show how it is possible for a large number of people to believe that Vietnam veterans were spat upon when there is no evidence that they were. In effect, my strategy was to set aside the question of whether or not such acts occurred and to show why even if they did not occur it is understandable that the image of the spat-upon veteran has become widely accepted. Indeed, given the manipulation of information and images that began with the Nixon administration and continued at the hands of filmmakers and the news media during the 1970s and 1980s, it would be remarkable if a majority of Americans had not come to believe that Vietnam veterans were abused by the anti-war movement.", "At the time he wrote ", ", Lembcke had not found a single substantiated media report to support the now common claims of spitting. He theorizes that the reported \"spitting on soldiers\" scenario was a mythical projection by those who felt \"spat upon\" by an American society tired of the war; an image which was then used to discredit future anti-war activism and serve political interests. He suggests that the manufactured images of pro-war antipathy against anti-war protesters also helped contribute to the myth. Lembcke asserts that memories of being verbally and physically assaulted by anti-war protesters were largely conjured, noting that not even one case could be reliably documented. He further suggests the \"baby-killer\" and \"murderer\" components of the myth may have been reinforced, in part, by the common chants by protesters aimed at President ", ", like \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\"\n", " asserts that the image of abuse of soldiers by anti-war demonstrators only really became ingrained in the American consciousness years after the war had come to a close. Lembcke attributes part of the legend's growth to films relating to Vietnam, notably ", ", in which a \"spat-upon veteran\" image is popularized. He writes that the myth of the spat-upon veteran was later revived by President ", " as a way to help suppress dissent when selling the ", " to the American people. Lembcke believes that resurrection of the myth was useful in promoting the ", " ", " campaign, as it implies that for one to support the troops, one must also support the war. It conflates the ideas of anti-war sentiment and anti-troop sentiment, despite a common anti-war chant being \"Support the Troops: Bring them Home!\"\n", "The \"spat-upon veteran\" meme became so pervasive that some found it hard not to believe. In 1989, Bob Greene's book ", " reprinted letters he had solicited, asking to hear from veterans if they had been spat upon.", " Greene's book includes 63 alleged accounts involving spitting, and 69 accounts from veterans who do not believe anyone was spat upon after returning from Vietnam, among other stories. Greene admits he couldn't validate the authenticity of the accounts in the letters he received, but he did believe spitting must have occurred, stating, \"There were simply too many letters, going into too fine a detail, to deny the fact.\" Greene concluded, \"I think you will agree, after reading the letters, that even if several should prove to be not what they appear to be, that does not detract from the overall story that is being told.\"", " \"Greene was too willing to suspend disbelief\", says Lembcke, who cited Greene's book as an example of how prolific the stories had become and also for the patterns that appeared in them.", " Lembke said, \"These stories have to be taken very seriously, but as historical evidence they are problematic. In the first place, stories of this type didn't surface until about ten years after the end of the war. If the incidents occurred when the story tellers say they did, in the closing years of the war, why is there no evidence for that? Moreover, many of the stories have elements of such exaggeration that one has to question the veracity of the entire account.\"", "\n", "Lembcke points out that there were several newspaper accounts of pro-war demonstrators spitting on anti-war demonstrators and suggests that these oral accounts could easily have been reinterpreted and inverted and made into stories about activists spitting on veterans.", " He highlights the contradictions between the collective memory of today and contemporaneous historical records, like the results from a 1971 poll showing over 94% of returning Vietnam soldiers received a \"friendly\" welcome.", " Lembcke also notes how it was older vets from previous wars who most often scorned the returning Vietnam Vets; in 1978 the ", " vowed in its founding principle: \"Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another\".", "\n", "In ", ", Lembcke acknowledges that he cannot prove the negative—that no Vietnam veteran was ever spat on—saying it is hard to imagine there not being expressions of hostility between veterans and activists.", " \"I cannot, of course, prove to anyone's satisfaction that spitting incidents like these did not happen. Indeed, it seems likely to me that it probably did happen to some veteran, some time, some place. But while I cannot prove the negative, I can prove the positive: I can show what did happen during those years and that that historical record makes it highly unlikely that the alleged acts of spitting occurred in the number and manner that is now widely believed.\"", "\n", "A review published in the ", " reads: \"The image is ingrained: A Vietnam veteran, arriving home from the war, gets off a plane only to be greeted by an ", " of antiwar protesters yelling, 'Murderer!' and 'Baby killer!' Then out of the crowd comes someone who spits in the veteran's face. The only problem, according to Jerry Lembcke, is that no such incident has ever been documented. It is instead, says Lembcke, a kind of ", " that reflects our lingering national confusion over the war.\"", "\n", "A review published in ", " called the book \"Well-argued and documented.\"", " ", " of the ", " wrote: \"The myth of the spat-upon veteran is not only bad history, but it has been instrumental in selling the American public on bad policy.\"", " A review published in the ", " argued that \"Lembcke builds a compelling case against collective memory by demonstrating that remembrances of Vietnam were almost at direct odds with circumstantial evidence.\"", " Peace activist ", " referred to the book as the \"best history I have seen on the impact of the war on Americans, both then and now.\"", "\n", "Karl Helicher of ", " wrote that Lembcke \"presents a stunning indictment of this myth, an illusion created, he maintains, by the Nixon-Agnew administration and an unwitting press to attribute America's loss in Vietnam to internal dissension. In fact, the antiwar movement and many veterans were closely aligned, and the only documented incidents show members of the VFW and American Legion spitting on their less successful Vietnam peers. But Lembcke's most controversial conclusion is that posttraumatic stress disorder was as much a political creation—a means of discrediting returning vets who protested the war as unhinged—as it was a medical condition. The image of the psycho-vet was furthered through such Hollywood productions as ", " and ", ". This forceful investigation challenges the reader to reexamine assumptions about the dark side of American culture that glorifies war more than peace. Highly recommended for large public libraries and for all academic peace studies collections.\"", "\n", " of ", " wrote that \"Lembcke's debunking of the spitting stories is quite persuasive. But he has much broader aims. Not only was there no spitting, he argues, but there was no hostility or tension at all between veterans and protesters. In fact, he characterizes their relationship as 'empathetic and mutually supporting.' ... My own view is that the spitting stories are largely mythic, but that the myth itself reflects the deep anger and animosity that many veterans harbored toward the antiwar movement. Their anger often reflected a sense of class injustice that gave their more privileged peers greater freedom to avoid the war. ... I base my conclusions on extensive interviews I have conducted with Vietnam veterans since the early 1980s. Lembcke, however, gives no credence to the possibility that veterans themselves played a role in creating the myth of antiwar spitters, or that the myth teaches us anything meaningful about the class and wartime experiences of veterans. For him, the myth is almost entirely a product of Hollywood and right-wing politicians.\"", "\n", "Mary Carroll of ", " wrote that Lembcke \"makes a strong case that tales of antiwar activists spitting at returning vets are myth. ... He notes that contemporary media, government, and polling data show no evidence of antiwar spitting incidents; the few events reported had supporters of the war targeting opponents. But later studies reported hostility toward veterans; \"the spitting image\" epitomized that narrative. Similar images were common in post-World War I Germany and France after Indochina; Lembcke suggests the Nixon administration cultivated this notion of betrayal because it stigmatized both the antiwar movement and veterans against the war.\"", "\n", "In 2000,", " 2004,", " and again in 2007,", " journalist ", " rekindled firestorms when he berated news media outlets for uncritically repeating the myth of the spat-upon veteran.

Shafer announced a challenge to his readers, \"Indeed, each time I write about the spit myth, my inbox overflows with e-mail from readers who claim that a spitting protester targeted them while they were in uniform. ... If you can point me to a documented case of a returning Viet vet getting spat upon, please drop a line.\"\n", "Likewise, Lembcke joined the discussion and also commented on it in the ", " journal, saying the stories just keep getting better, and asking for any evidence to be raised. The discussions spawned yet another round of more than 60 stories, yet only one was credible.", "\n", "Northwestern Law School professor ", " also joined the discussions and, after a review of contemporary news sources, found many news accounts from the 1960s and 1970s that discussed spitting incidents against servicemembers, contrary to Lembcke's claims that stories about spitting only began occurring in 1980.", " Lembcke provided an 18-point response to Lindgren's research, offering rebuttals to most of his claims and expressing interest in one of them.", " A December 27, 1971 ", " report on veteran Delmar Pickett who said he was spat at in Seattle appeared, according to Lembcke, to have some validity as a claim.", "\n", "Some second-hand news accounts that mention spitting do actually exist, although there has been no evidence to support the narrative that anti-war demonstrators were responsible. Documented accounts exist where the anti-war demonstrators were actually the victims, not the perpetrators.", "  Other commentators have since addressed the myth to various degrees, even referencing the debate spawned by the Slate files.\n", "In his 2009 book ", ", historian and Vietnam veteran Gary Kulik devoted a whole chapter to the myth of \"Spit-upon veterans\".  He closely examined Greene's book of letters and the Slate files, as well as the research by Lindgren and Lembcke.  Kulik noted the contradictory nature of the stories in Greene's book and concluded that Greene arrogantly dismissed the \"surprising number\" of veterans who \"refuse to believe\" the spitting stories, and wrote, \"Greene was not just credulous, but negligently irresponsible.\" Kulik also criticized Lindgren's research, writing, \"Lindgren's evidence includes only one single first-person (\"I was spit upon\") account—the stories that are at the heart of Lembcke's book—and it appears the none of the accounts he cites were actually witnessed by a reporter. Moreover, Lindgren does not cite a single case of a Vietnam veteran spit upon as he returned home, and that was the story that would ultimately be repeated and believed.\" Kulik concluded that the spitting stories were formulaic and unbelievable, and were propagated to serve the political goals of those who wished to vilify the anti-war movement. \"The image of 'hippie' men and women hawking up gobs of phlegm to hurl at the ribbons of veterans, as a pervasive and commonplace act, is surely false.\"", "\n", "Specialist in civil-military relations and advisor to the National Institute of Military Justice, Diane Mazur, also examined the works by Greene, Lembcke and Lindgren, and concluded: \"There is no contemporaneous evidence that Americans who opposed the war expressed those beliefs by spitting on or otherwise assaulting returning Vietnam Veterans. ... The idea, however, that spitting on or mistreating Vietnam veterans was in any way typical or representative of anything in that era is completely false. ... It is by far the most powerful Vietnam War meme—a cultural unit of information passed from one person to another, like a biological gene—because it can be deployed instantly to silence difficult but necessary conversations about the military. For that reason alone the conventional wisdom is important, because it explains much about our civil-military dynamic today. It is also important, however, to understand why that accepted memory is untrue, and who benefits most from keeping it alive. The myth of the spat-upon Vietnam veteran is a difficult one to challenge. ... One intrepid soul, Professor Jerry Lembcke, ... stepped into the fray ... Every time he discusses his findings in a public forum, a hail of angry responses follows, but his explanations and conclusions are compelling and unsettling.\"", "\n"]},

In order to meet conditions where slavery may continue to exist, members of the master class (e.g., white, landowning, slave-owning) had to compete with other members of the master class to maximize the surplus labor extracted from slaves.

Many, if not most, of the factory workers and miners were recent immigrants from Europe, or their children.

If we say that gender exploration therapy is fringe and is the same as conversion therapy, then that means that the Swedish authorities support fringe theories. That is too strong claim to make.

Based on the results of the studies, the need for and timeliness of medically justified treatments will be assessed individually.\" I think claiming consensus here is too premature, as there is an ongoing debate worldwide.

Far from reacting against German romanticism as the other members of Les Six did, Honegger's mature works show evidence of a distinct influence by it. \"I place great importance on musical architecture\", he wrote, \"which I would never want to see sacrificed for literary or pictorial reasons.

On the contrary, I believe we should use the harmonic materials developed by the school that preceded us, but in a different way—as a base for lines and rhythms. Bach makes use of the elements of tonal harmony, just as I wish to make use of modern harmonic overlays.

Halbreich notes that after ", ",  \"The need to communicate took precedence over all others, and in his freely chosen mission as \"musician in the city of men\" Honegger considered the maintenance of an esoteric and avant-garde language as a narcissistic luxury contrary to his humanist demands, even if the aesthetes of art for art's sake suffered and disapproved of his choice. His only subsequent attempt at opera, ", ", was aimed at the immediate (and, it was accepted, perhaps ephemeral) approval of a vast popular audience, not that of a hypothetical and elitist posterity\".", " It is for this reason that Honegger often aspired to a music free from too much formalism, too much seduction, and above all, in general, from musical habits. All his life he feared the danger of cultural habits, of different forms of collective consciousness (", ", 1931, the subject of which is \"the revolt of the individual against the crowd that crushes him\" according to Honegger, ", ", December 1931).

In particular, remember that ", " and we do not need citations for the meanings of everyday words and phrases.\n", "A common form of citation overkill is adding sources to an article without regard as to whether they support substantive or noteworthy content about the topic. This may boost the number of footnotes and create a superficial appearance of notability, which can obscure a lack of substantive, reliable, and relevant information. This phenomenon is especially common in articles about people and organizations.\n", "Examples of this type of citation overkill include:\n", "Some people might try to rest notability on a handful of sources that do not contribute, while other people might try to build the pile of sources up into the dozens or even hundreds instead – so this type of citation overkill may require special attention. Either way, the principle is the same: Sources support notability based on what they say about the topic, not just the number of footnotes present. An article with just four or five really good sources is considered better referenced than an article that cites 500 bad ones.\n", "Overloading an article with bad citations can backfire if the article is nominated for deletion. Participators may not want to look at all one hundred citations, and they may instead choose to look at just a smaller sample. If they find only unreliable sources or sources that do not discuss the subject in depth, they could recommend deletion.

If you say an elephant is a mammal more than once, provide one only at the first instance.\n", "Avoid cluttering text with redundant citations like this:\n", "In addition, as per ", ", citations should be placed at the end of the passage that they support. If one source alone supports consecutive sentences in the same paragraph, one citation of it at the end of the final sentence is sufficient.

Doing so may benefit others adding material to that paragraph in the future. If that happens, they can uncomment the hidden citations and switch to citing references after every sentence. Having hidden citations could cause confusion, especially among inexperienced editors, so the approach is strictly optional and should be used cautiously.\n", "Another common form of citation overkill is to cite multiple reprintings of the same content in different publications – such as several different newspapers reprinting the same ", " article, or a newspaper or magazine article getting picked up by a ", " – as if they constituted distinct citations. Such duplicated citations may be piled up as multiple references for the same fact or they may be split up as distinct footnotes for different pieces of content, so watching out for this type of overkill may sometimes require special attention.\n", "This type of overkill should be resolved by merging all of the citations into a single one and stripping unhelpful repetitions – when possible, the retained citation should be the originator of the content rather than a reprinter or aggregator, but if this is not possible (e.g. some wire service articles) then retain the ", " reliable and widely distributed available reprinter (for example, if the same article has been linked to both ", " and ", ", then ", " should be retained as the citation link.)\n", "A similar case is redundant citation of an article that got its information from an article we have already cited.

For example, if the six citations include two books, two journal articles, and two encyclopedia articles, the citations could be trimmed down to one citation from each type of source. Comprehensive works on a topic often include many of the same points.

In these cases, a few of the older citations could be removed.\n", "For many subjects, some sources are official or otherwise authoritative, while others are only interpretive, summarizing, or opinionated.

However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God's will expressed through his creation. In other words, man can discover the geometric forms that constitute the arabesque, but these forms always existed before as part of God's creation, as shown in this picture.\n", "There is great similarity between arabesque artwork from very different geographic regions.", " In fact, the similarities are so pronounced that it is sometimes difficult for experts to tell where a given style of arabesque comes from.

These were reproduced by Raphael and his pupils in the decoration of some of the corridors of the Loggie of the Vatican at Rome: grotesque is thus a better name for these decorations than Arabesque. This technical Arabesque, therefore, is much more ancient than any Arabian or Moorish decoration, and has really nothing in common with it except the mere symmetrical principles of its arrangement. Pliny and Vitruvius give us no name for the extravagant decorative wall-painting in vogue in their time, to which the early Italian revivers of it seem to have given the designation of grotesque, because it, was first discovered in the arched or underground chambers (grotte) of Roman ruins—as in the golden house of Nero, or the baths of Titus.

It is important to mention, however, that this primal essence is not an objectifiable entity whose possible correlate is knowledge; thus, even if philosophy is always concerned with knowing, as Scheler would concur, nevertheless, reason itself is not the proper participative faculty by which the greatest level of knowing is achieved. Only when reason and logic have behind them the movement of love and the proper moral preconditions can one achieve philosophical knowledge.", " (2) Love is likewise important insofar as its essence is the condition for the possibility of the givenness of value-objects and especially the givenness of an object in terms of its highest possible value. Love is the movement which \"brings about the continuous emergence of ever-higher value in the object--just as if it was streaming out from the object of its own accord, without any sort of exertion...on the part of the lover. ...true love opens our spiritual eyes to ever-higher values in the object loved.\"", " Hatred, on the other hand, is the closing off of oneself or closing one's eyes to the world of values. It is in the latter context that value-inversions or devaluations become prevalent, and are sometimes solidified as proper in societies. Furthermore, by calling love a movement, Scheler hopes to dispel the interpretation that love and hate are only reactions to felt values rather than the very ground for the possibility of value-givenness (or value-concealment).

In 1931, Zhou Yitong proposed for the first time that \"oracle bone science\" was an independent discipline.", " Wang Yuxin emphasized that oracle bones are precious cultural relics and historical materials left over from the ancient period, but their value for archaeological and historical research lies in orthography beyond script interpretation, which has become increasingly recognized by scholars as orthography develops.

However, no clearly identifiable examples of writing dating prior to the 13th century BC have been discovered.

The more detailed and more pictorial style of the bronze graphs is thought to be more representative of typical Shang writing using bamboo books than the oracle bone forms; this typical style continued to evolve into writing styles of the Western Zhou period, and then into the ", " within the ", ".\n", "It is known that the Shang people also wrote with brush and ink, as brush-written graphs have been found on a small number of pottery, shell and bone, and jade and other stone items,", " and there is evidence that they also wrote on bamboo (or wooden) books", " just like those found from the late Zhou to ", " periods, because the graphs for a writing brush (", " ", ", depicting a hand holding a writing brush", ") and bamboo book (", " ", ", a book of thin ", " bound with horizontal strings, like a ", " turned 90 degrees), are present in oracle bone inscriptions.", "\n", "Since the ease of writing with a brush is even greater than that of writing with a ", " in wet clay, it is assumed that the style and structure of Shang graphs on bamboo were similar to those on bronzes, and also that the majority of writing occurred with a brush on such books.", " Additional support for this notion includes the reorientation of some graphs,", " by rotating them 90 degrees, as if to better fit on tall, narrow slats.

Additionally, the layout of characters in columns from top to bottom is mostly carried over from bamboo books.", " In some instances, characters are instead written in rows in order to match the text with divinatory cracks; in others, columns of text rotate 90 degrees mid-phrase. These are exceptions to the normal pattern of writing,", " and inscriptions were never read bottom to top.", " Columns of text in Chinese writing are traditionally laid out from right to left; this pattern is first found with the Shang-era bronze inscriptions. However, oracle bone inscriptions are often arranged with columns beginning near the center of the shell or bone, then moving toward the edge such that the two sides mirror one another.", "\n", "Despite the pictorial nature of the oracle bone script, it was a fully functional and mature writing system by the time of the Shang dynasty,", " meaning it was able to record the ", " language, and not merely fragments of ideas or words.

Without careful research to compare these to later forms, one would probably not know that these represented ", " 'swine' and ", " 'dog' respectively. As William G. Boltz notes, most of the oracle bone graphs are not depicted realistically enough for those who do not already know the script to recognize what they stand for; although pictographic in origin, they are no longer pictographs in function.

By the early ", " period, these traits had vanished, but in both periods, the script was not highly regular or standardized; variant forms of graphs abound, and the size and orientation of graphs is also irregular.

The majority of these still remain undeciphered, although scholars believe they can decipher between 1,500 and 2,000 of these characters.", " One reason for the difficulty in decipherment is that components of certain oracle bone script characters may differ in later script forms. Such differences may be accounted for by character simplification and/or by later generations misunderstanding the original graph, which had evolved beyond recognition. For instance, the standard character ", " 'autumn' now appears with the components ", " 'plant stalk' and ", " 'fire', whereas the oracle bone form depicts an insect-like figure with ", " – either a ", " or a ", " – with a variant depicting fire ", " below said figure.

An example is a fragment bearing character for 'spring' that has no known modern  counterpart. In such cases, available context may be used to determine the possible meaning of the character. In other cases, the character may be assumed to be a ", ", and a rough meaning can be inferred based on the semantic component.

Following Shang Yang's reforms, the aristocracy system was abolished and replaced by a meritocracy, in which ordinary citizens had the same opportunities as the nobles to be promoted to high ranks.

Over the following years, Zhang engineered and executed a number of diplomatic plots against Chu, supported by the constant military raids on Chu's north-western border. Chu suffered many defeats in battles against Qin and was forced to cede territories to Qin. King Huai I of Chu was furious and ordered a military campaign against Qin, but he was tricked by Zhang Yi into breaking diplomatic ties with his allies, and his angered allies joined Qin in inflicting a crushing defeat on Chu. In 299 BC, King Huai I was tricked into attending a diplomatic conference in Qin, where he was captured and held hostage until his death.

King Zhaoxiang heeded this advice and altered Qin's foreign policy to foster good diplomatic relations with the distant states of Yan and Qi, while focusing on attacking nearby Zhao, Han, and Wei. As a result, Qin began to launch constant attacks on Han and Wei over the subsequent decades, conquering several territories in its campaigns. By then, Qin's territories had expanded beyond the eastern shore of the ", ", and Han and Wei were reduced to the status of \"buffers\" for Qin against the other states in the east.\n", "In 265 BC, Qin launched a massive invasion on Han and forced Han to cede its territory of Shangdang (", "; modern Shanxi).
