I have chosen to document a database, by generating an entity relationship diagram, 
using the free tool: "dbdiagram.io".


Step one: get sql dump
- server -> data export
- I select the db i want to export
- Export to Self-contained File
- Start export
- go to dumps folder and copy contents of File

Step 2:
- go to https://dbdiagram.io/d 
- click import -> mysql
- paste dump in the modal

And now a erd is generated
